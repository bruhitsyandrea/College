## Description
In this assignment we are given a file four files: password_checker.h, password_checker.c, test_password_checker.c, and a Makefile. We are supposed to modify passoword_checker.c to pass all the testcases in test_password_checker.c. 

## How I Did It
I start with fixing the issue in my Makefile. Then I commented out the boolean object in check_password to test each function, since each valuable is related to one function. I also followed the instruction on the test case. Until I got the result that I passed all 10 testcases.
